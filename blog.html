            <h3>Question-2: Write Down the Differences Between Global Scope and Block Scope.</h3>
            <h4 class="py-2">Answer:</h4>
            <h6><strong>Global Scope :</strong> Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
                Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
                Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. A global
                variable exists only once in a script, and is visible in every function.Modifications to it in one
                function are permanent and visible to all functions. Unless declared otherwise, all variables in a
                script are global. </h6>
            <h6><strong>Block Scope :</strong> This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific
                block, from access by the outside of the block.The block is delimited by a pair of braces ("curly
                brackets") and contains a list of zero or more statements and declarations. The let & const keyword
                facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In order to access the variables of that specific block,
                we need to create an object for it.</h6>

            <h3>Question-3: How does event loop works in JavaScript?</h3>
            <h4 class="py-2">Answer:</h4>
            <h6>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
                collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from
                models in other languages like C and Java.
                <br>The Event Loop has one simple job - to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

            <h3>Question-4: Write down the ways to get undefined.</h3>
            <h4 class="py-2">Answer:</h4>
            <h6 class="ps-3"> Here, 8 ways to get undefined: </h6>
            <h6 class="ps-5">
                1. variable that is not initialized will give undefined <br>
                2. function without return <br>
                3. parameter that is not passed will be undefined <br>
                4. if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined <br>
                5. property that does not exists on an object will give undefined <br>
                6. accessing array elements outside of the index range will give undefined <br>
                7. deleting an element inside an array <br>
                8. set a value directly to undefined
